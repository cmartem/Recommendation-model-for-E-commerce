Task: develop a model that can analyze customer behavior and recommend one of newest plans. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75.

Data: behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since you’ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model.

After several launches, only a random forest behaved stably. In the data, the proportion of tariffs is distributed in the ratio of 69% to 31%.
